    - title: Data Scientist
      institution: Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda
      year: 2023 - Todate
      description:
        - This role focused on  in-depth analysis of academic data to glean insights about application, enrollment,
          academic performance, student dropout, graduation and employability of the University graduates.
          It required deep analysis of student lifecycle through use of  Probabilistic Programming using PyMC,
          Machine Learning Models, Visualization, Automation, and integration and deployment of models in
          various University Information Systems.
        - title: Key Achievements
          contents: 
          - Conducted comprehensive data analysis to model and understand the full student journey, from admission to post-graduation outcomes.
          - Employed Probabilistic Programming (using PyMC) to model uncertainty and make robust predictions about student behaviors and outcomes.
          - Developed and implemented machine learning models to identify patterns and trends in student performance and retention.
          - Designed data visualizations to communicate complex insights to academic and administrative stakeholders.
          - Automated data pipelines and reporting processes to enhance efficiency and data reliability.
          - Integrated and deployed predictive models into various University Information Systems, enabling real-time decision-making and operational improvements.
